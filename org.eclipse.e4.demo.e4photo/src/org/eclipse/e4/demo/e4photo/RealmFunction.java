 * This is an example of a context function that is contributed declaratively using

 * attempts to retrieve a "realm" value from a context, they will get the value returned
 * by this function, unless a more specific context has registered a different realm. Declarative
 * services allows the function to be instantiated lazily only when a client first requests it.
 * A more elaborate function could use values defined the provided context to select
 * or customize the concrete service object returned from the function.
